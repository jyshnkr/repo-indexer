            Review this pull request for:
            1. Security issues (path traversal, command injection, unsafe eval)
            2. Error handling — unhandled exceptions, bare excepts, missing exit codes
            3. stdlib-only compliance — no external dependencies allowed at runtime
            4. POSIX shell correctness — set -e present, no bashisms, proper quoting
            5. Python 3.9+ compatibility — no 3.10+ syntax or features
            Be concise. Flag real issues only, not style preferences.
